## v1.1.0

### New Features

- **Multi-provider AI configuration** — Database-backed provider management with full CRUD API. Added native Anthropic Messages API support alongside OpenAI-compatible providers.
- **AI Agent enhancements** — Dynamic system prompts, sub-agent support, parallel tool execution, and batch command processing.
- **Unified approval system** — Merged AI and opsctl approval dialogs into a single workflow. Supports batch confirmation, Grant mechanism with editable command patterns, and remember mode.
- **AI model intelligence** — Model parameter presets with auto-fill on selection, context window auto-compression, and Anthropic prompt caching optimization.
- **Multi-asset permission requests** — `request_permission` tool now supports multi-asset `items` parameter, consistent with `opsctl grant`.
- **opsctl improvements** — Redis `-n` flag for database selection; `create/update asset` supports `--icon` parameter.

### UI/UX Improvements

- **AI setup wizard redesign** — New opsctl plugin banner, improved provider selection cards, extracted shared `AIProviderForm` component.
- **AI chat UI refactoring** — Chat header, role labels, solid assistant bubbles, independent approval block rendering.
- **Terminal Aesthetic theme** — New visual style for the application interface.
- **AI settings enhancement** — Model list fetching from API, model selector with search, token parameter configuration.
- **Approval block improvements** — Differentiated rendering for single/batch/grant types; only pending approvals interrupt message flow.
- **ToolBlock & AgentBlock refinements** — Optimized spacing, line height, running state indicator, error state icons.
- **GFM Markdown support** — AI chat now renders GitHub Flavored Markdown (tables, strikethrough, task lists).
- **Database & Redis UX** — Improved frontend user experience for query modules.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed Windows subprocess causing a brief black window flash on launch.

- Fixed `SSHPool.Close()` panic on double-call.
- Fixed opsctl `exec_sql`/`exec_redis`/`cp` audit logs missing decision and decision source.

### Backend Improvements

- **User denial handling** — Strong stop instructions when user denies commands; system prompt includes denial guidance to prevent AI from attempting workarounds.
- **Concurrency safety** — Approval callbacks now receive conversation ID via context instead of instance variable.
- Error messages in AI module standardized to English for better LLM comprehension.

### Other

- Added GPLv3 License.
- Updated README links to opskat.github.io.
